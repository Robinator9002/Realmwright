### Project Overview

**Realmwright** is an ambitious, offline-first Pen & Paper command center designed to be the ultimate tool for Dungeon Masters. Built with React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS, it serves as an indispensable digital companion for crafting, managing, and running deeply immersive campaigns. Whether you are a meticulous world-builder or a quick-thinking improviser, Realmwright aims to streamline your workflow and amplify your storytelling.

### üéØ Core Concept

Realmwright is founded on the philosophy of being an **Adaptive Command Center**. It's a powerful, non-distracting tool that enhances the TTRPG experience by prioritizing speed, intuitive design, and flexibility. The core of the application is its robust **offline-first architecture** using IndexedDB (via Dexie.js), ensuring that your entire world is always available, fast, and reliable, regardless of internet connectivity.

### ‚ú® Key Features (Planned)

* **üèõÔ∏è Hierarchical World Management:** Build self-contained worlds, each with its own campaigns, characters, lore, maps, and rule systems.
* **üé≠ Modular Character Creator:** Design any character type (PC, NPC, Enemy) with a flexible system of modular components for descriptions, stats, and abilities.
* **üï∏Ô∏è Node-Based Ability Tree Editor:** Visually design intricate skill progressions with complex prerequisites and attachment points for ultimate customization.
* **üó∫Ô∏è Interactive Map & Lore Creator:** Craft and link interactive maps with a deeply integrated, timeline-based lore and chronicle keeper.
* **‚ö° Two-Mode Interface:** Seamlessly switch between **Creation/Management Mode** for deep world-building and **Active Play Mode**‚Äîa live DM console for running sessions with trackers for quests, combat, and player status.
* **üì¶ Robust Data Handling:** All data is stored locally in your browser, providing lightning-fast access and full offline functionality. Includes proprietary text-based import/export for sharing entire worlds.

### üí° The "Why": A Tool Forged from Experience

As a Dungeon Master who has run countless sessions, I've always yearned for a single, cohesive tool that could handle the sprawling complexity of a homebrew world without getting in the way. Existing solutions are often too rigid, too slow, or too focused on a single ruleset. Realmwright is born from that need‚Äîan opinionated, yet flexible, system designed by a DM, for DMs. It's an experiment to see if we can create a digital tool that feels less like software and more like an extension of the storyteller's mind.

### üó∫Ô∏è Project Roadmap

This project is in the initial architectural phase. We are establishing the foundational data structures and planning the core modules. The development will proceed in stages, focusing first on the "Creation Mode" components.

1.  **Base Camp 1: The Core Data Model:** Finalize the Dexie.js database schema for Worlds, Campaigns, Characters, and Lore.
2.  **Base Camp 2: The Writer's Workshop (MVP):** Implement the core creation tools for Worlds, Campaigns, and basic text-only Characters and Lore entries.
3.  **Base Camp 3: The System Architect:** Build the Rule Creator and integrate stats and abilities into the Character Creator.
4.  **Base Camp 4: The Live Console:** Develop the "Active Play Mode" with its various trackers.
5.  **The Summit Push:** Implement advanced features like the Map Creator and the node-based Ability Tree Editor.
